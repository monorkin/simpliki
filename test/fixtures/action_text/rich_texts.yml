      <b>Box breathing</b> is a simple yet powerful relaxation technique 
      that involves breathing in a rhythmic pattern of equal counts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By inhaling deeply for four counts, holding for four counts, 
      exhaling for four counts, and holding again for four counts, 
      you create a "box" of four equal sides with your breath. This 
      practice activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps 
      reduce stress hormones and induces a calming response throughout the 
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of box breathing extend beyond immediate stress relief. 
      Regular practice can improve concentration, regulate blood pressure, 
      enhance emotional regulation, and even boost immune function. Many 
      high-performing professionals, including military personnel, athletes, 
      and executives, incorporate box breathing into their daily routines to 
      maintain composure during high-pressure situations and optimize 
      decision-making capabilities. It's particularly valuable because it 
      requires no special equipment and can be practiced discreetly almost 
      anywhere, making it an accessible tool for managing stress and anxiety 
      in real-time.

      <b>4-7-8 breathing</b> is a rhythmic breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil
      that acts as a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice involves inhaling quietly through the nose for 4 counts,
      holding the breath for 7 counts, and exhaling completely through the mouth
      for 8 counts. This deliberate pattern helps shift the body from a sympathetic
      (fight-or-flight) state to a parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) state,
      effectively reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular practice of 4-7-8 breathing offers numerous benefits including reduced
      stress and anxiety, improved sleep quality, decreased blood pressure, and enhanced
      focus. The technique is particularly effective because it can be performed anywhere
      and requires only a few minutes. Many healthcare professionals recommend this
      breathing exercise for managing panic attacks, controlling emotional responses,
      and as a supplementary approach for those dealing with chronic stress conditions.
      The longer exhalation phase compared to inhalation is especially effective at
      triggering the relaxation response, making it an excellent tool for quickly
      achieving a state of calm even in challenging situations.

      <b>Coherent breathing</b> is a scientifically validated breathing technique that involves 
      inhaling and exhaling at a steady rate of about 5 breaths per minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deliberate rhythm—typically breathing in for about 5-6 seconds and breathing out for 
      the same duration—helps synchronize your heart rate, blood pressure, and autonomic nervous 
      system functions. The practice creates what scientists call "respiratory sinus arrhythmia," 
      a healthy pattern where heart rate increases slightly during inhalation and decreases during 
      exhalation, leading to improved heart rate variability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of coherent breathing are extensive and well-documented. Regular practice 
      has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, lower blood pressure, improve immune function, 
      enhance cognitive performance, and promote emotional regulation. Coherent breathing is 
      particularly valuable for managing chronic stress conditions and has been incorporated into 
      various therapeutic protocols. It serves as an excellent bridge between mindfulness and 
      physiological regulation, as its steady rhythm makes it easy to maintain focus while 
      simultaneously balancing the autonomic nervous system. Many practitioners find that just 
      five minutes of coherent breathing can produce noticeable shifts in mental clarity and 
      physical tension, making it an efficient tool for daily stress management.

      <b>Equal breathing</b>, also known as "Sama Vritti" in Sanskrit, is a foundational 
      yogic breathing technique that emphasizes matching the length of your inhalation 
      to your exhalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice typically begins with counting to four for both inhalation and exhalation, 
      though practitioners may gradually extend this count to six or eight as their lung capacity 
      and control improve. Unlike some other breathing techniques, equal breathing maintains the 
      same duration for both breath phases, creating a balanced, harmonious rhythm that reflects 
      its Sanskrit name meaning "equal movement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Equal breathing offers significant benefits for both mind and body. By creating symmetry in 
      the breathing pattern, it helps establish a sense of balance in the nervous system, reducing 
      stress and anxiety while promoting mental clarity and focus. The technique is particularly 
      effective for calming racing thoughts, managing emotional reactivity, and preparing the mind 
      for meditation or sleep. Its simplicity makes it accessible to beginners, while its versatility 
      allows it to be practiced anywhere—during a commute, before an important meeting, or while 
      lying in bed. Many practitioners appreciate equal breathing because it provides a gentle 
      entry point into more advanced breathing techniques while still offering immediate calming 
      effects. For those new to breathwork, equal breathing serves as an excellent foundation for 
      developing greater respiratory awareness and control.

    <p>
      <b>Pursed lip breathing</b> is a simple yet effective breathing technique that involves 
      inhaling through the nose and exhaling slowly through pursed lips, as if gently blowing 
      through a straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice typically follows a 2:4 ratio—inhaling through the nose for 2 counts, then 
      exhaling through pursed lips for 4 counts. This controlled exhalation creates slight back 
      pressure in the airways, helping them stay open longer and allowing more complete exhalation. 
      By slowing the breathing rate and promoting full exhalation, pursed lip breathing helps 
      release trapped air from the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursed lip breathing offers significant benefits, particularly for those with respiratory 
      conditions like COPD, asthma, or emphysema. The technique helps reduce shortness of breath, 
      improves ventilation, increases oxygen levels, and decreases the work of breathing. Beyond 
      respiratory support, regular practice can reduce anxiety, promote relaxation, and provide 
      a practical tool for managing breathlessness during physical activity or periods of stress. 
      Healthcare professionals often recommend pursed lip breathing as a self-management strategy 
      because it's easy to learn, requires no equipment, and can be practiced anywhere. Many 
      people find that incorporating just a few minutes of pursed lip breathing into their daily 
      routine can significantly improve their breathing efficiency and overall sense of well-being.
