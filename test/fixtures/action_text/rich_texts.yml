      <b>Box breathing</b> is a simple yet powerful relaxation technique 
      that involves breathing in a rhythmic pattern of equal counts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By inhaling deeply for four counts, holding for four counts, 
      exhaling for four counts, and holding again for four counts, 
      you create a "box" of four equal sides with your breath. This 
      practice activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps 
      reduce stress hormones and induces a calming response throughout the 
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of box breathing extend beyond immediate stress relief. 
      Regular practice can improve concentration, regulate blood pressure, 
      enhance emotional regulation, and even boost immune function. Many 
      high-performing professionals, including military personnel, athletes, 
      and executives, incorporate box breathing into their daily routines to 
      maintain composure during high-pressure situations and optimize 
      decision-making capabilities. It's particularly valuable because it 
      requires no special equipment and can be practiced discreetly almost 
      anywhere, making it an accessible tool for managing stress and anxiety 
      in real-time.

      <b>4-7-8 breathing</b> is a rhythmic breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil
      that acts as a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice involves inhaling quietly through the nose for 4 counts,
      holding the breath for 7 counts, and exhaling completely through the mouth
      for 8 counts. This deliberate pattern helps shift the body from a sympathetic
      (fight-or-flight) state to a parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) state,
      effectively reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular practice of 4-7-8 breathing offers numerous benefits including reduced
      stress and anxiety, improved sleep quality, decreased blood pressure, and enhanced
      focus. The technique is particularly effective because it can be performed anywhere
      and requires only a few minutes. Many healthcare professionals recommend this
      breathing exercise for managing panic attacks, controlling emotional responses,
      and as a supplementary approach for those dealing with chronic stress conditions.
      The longer exhalation phase compared to inhalation is especially effective at
      triggering the relaxation response, making it an excellent tool for quickly
      achieving a state of calm even in challenging situations.
